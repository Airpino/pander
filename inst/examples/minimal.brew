% Minimal example for `Pandoc.brew`

# Introduction

We have two meta-information above:

  * author
  * title

A third field could be there too: date. For details, please check out [Pandoc's homepage](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#title-block) or just use `pandoc.title` function of this package.

As you can see writing and formatting paragraphs cannot be easier :)

But what about [R](http://www.r-project.org/)? Let us return pi: <%=pi%>

# R objects

`Pander.brew` would transform any returned R object to Pandoc's markdown in each code block.

For example `mtcars`'s first 5 cases look like:

<%=mtcars[1:5, ]%>

As you can see some formatting was added to the returned table and was also split up as the original table would have been too wide.

We could try other R objects too, for example `prcomp` on `iris`:

<%=prcomp(iris[, 1:4])%>

## Returning plot

Plots are automatically grabbed between `brew` tags:

<%=
library(lattice)
histogram(mtcars$hp)
%>
